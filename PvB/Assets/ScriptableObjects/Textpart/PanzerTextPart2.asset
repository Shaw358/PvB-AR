  partText: The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV medium tanks by
    1940/1941.[4] By the end of 1942, it had been largely removed from front line
    service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts.[4] The turrets
    of the then-obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially
    built defensive bunkers,[5] particularly on the Atlantic Wall. Production of
    the tank itself ceased by January 1944, but its chassis remained in use as the
    basis of several other armoured vehicles, chiefly self-propelled artillery and
    tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II respectively.
